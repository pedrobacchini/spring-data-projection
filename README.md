# Alternative of JsonView in Spring Data

@JsonView helping me to filter out certain fields in output data dynamically. But before it filtering out all the queries have been executed.

I want to ignore the fields before querying it from database in order to avoid unnecessary queries to association tables.(@JsonIgnore works in this way. But it is not dynamic). Please help me out
